# For Loops Lab
In the next ten minutes create a series of for loops:
1. A loop that will display a string 99 times. 
2. A loop that will display every odd number from 0 to 99
3. A loop that will display every even number from 0 to 99
4. The same loop as 3, but in a different way.
5. A loop that will sum up the odd numbers from 0 to 99 and print it at the end. 
6. A loop that will sum up the even numbers from 0 to 99 and print it at the end. 
7. A loop that finds a sum of the numbers between two numbers that are given by the user, inclusive.
